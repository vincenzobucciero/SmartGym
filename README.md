# SmartGym

# Introduction
SmartGym is a revolutionary project developed by our team aimed at creating an efficient registration platform for gyms, benefiting both gym owners and end users. The primary objective of this project is to establish a comprehensive database of gym users, where each individual can maintain a personal workout record tailored to their preferences and goals. One of the key features of SmartGym is the generation of personalized workout cards, accompanied by a collection of free copyright exercise videos to guide users through their fitness journey.

# Features

* User Registration: Gym owners can register their gyms on the platform, and users can create individual accounts with their personal details and fitness preferences.

* Personalized Workout Cards: Users can input their workout preferences, such as target areas, intensity level, and preferred exercises. SmartGym generates customized workout cards based on these choices.

* Exercise Videos: Each generated workout card is equipped with links to free copyright exercise videos. Users can watch these videos to ensure proper form and technique for each exercise.

* Database Management: The platform maintains a secure and scalable database, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user information.

# How It Works
