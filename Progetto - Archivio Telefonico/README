/*  Telephone archive management
     You want to simulate the telephone archive of a mobile phone. Each name is identified
     from Surname, Name, telephone number. Provide implementation
     of the algorithm for simulating the telephone archive (maximum 30 names).
     Also allow the user to
       • Insert or delete a name
       • Given the Surname and Name of a user, display the telephone number
       matching (perform a recursive binary search)
       • Given a telephone number see the total number of calls to and from
       that number
     The archive can also be initialized with random information. Make it at least
     two tests for each of the user options.  */
