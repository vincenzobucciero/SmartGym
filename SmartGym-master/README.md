## Project Overview

Our team is working to create a useful registration platform for gyms that can also be useful for end users. The ultimate goal is to make a database with users and each user will have their own personal record based on their choices. Once the workout cards is generated the user will have videos of the exercises, all of which are free copyright videos.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want explicit instructions that tell me what exercises to conduct, and how to do them properly.
2. As a user, I want an intuitive interface with minimal friction that allows me to generate a workout in just a couple of minutes.
3. As a user, I want my favorite workouts to be saved for me to reference at a later date.
